You need ffmpeg installed on your machine before you can run this.

Go into /Api and copy .env-example to a .env file and set the environment variables to the correct values for your system. Directory is where the music will be saved, ffmpegpath is the location of your ffpmeg install. 

You can run the api with the command ```node index.js```

The chrome extension is also pretty standard. Go to manage extensions in chrome and load unpacked. Now, pin it to the task bar as you would any commonly used extension. The icon will be visible on the task bar and can be clicked. Do this on a youtube video to download it. 

Don't abuse it. I never ran into any trouble until doing about 20hrs worth of audio in under an hour haha
